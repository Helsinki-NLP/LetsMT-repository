# The LetsMT! repository software

LetsMT! was a European project on developing an on-line platform for user-tailored machine translation and included the development of a resource repository that makes it easy to create parallel corpora for training SMT models. This package includes the repository software that can be set up as a backend for storing and processing data.

The description of the original software is included in a technical report: [D2.2.pdf](D2.2.pdf)

The document above includes a detailed overview of the LetsMT repository API, command-line tools etc. The basic concepts and most of the components are still the same with some [modifications and updates](Changes.md) that are described in the documentation below. The documentation below is an on-going effort to migrate from the [original project](http://opus.nlpl.eu/letsmt-trac/wiki) with additional tutorials and examples to make it easier to get started with the current version of the software.
