# The LetsMT! repository software

LetsMT! was a European project on developing an on-line platform for user-tailored machine translation and included the development of a resource repository that makes it easy to create parallel corpora for training SMT models. This package includes the repository software that can be set up as a backend for storing and processing data.

This documentation is on-going and includes information about typical tasks that need to be performed. Below is the current lists of tutorials:
