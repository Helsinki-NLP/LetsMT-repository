# The LetsMT! repository software

LetsMT! was a European project on developing an on-line platform for user-tailored machine translation and included the development of a resource repository that makes it easy to create parallel corpora for training SMT models. This package includes the repository software that can be set up as a backend for storing and processing data.

The description of the original software is included in a technical report: [D2.2.pdf](D2.2.pdf)

This includes a detailed overview of the LetsMT repository API, command-line tools etc. The basic concepts and most of the compnents are the same with some changes and updates that are described in this on-line documentation. For better explanation, we list various tutorials and examples below. This documentation is an on-going effort and subject to change. Here is a list of the current documentation collected in this repository:
