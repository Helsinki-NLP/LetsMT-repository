To do as of version 0.56
========================


High priority:

* jobs for starting word alignment and parsing
* check memory leak in sentence alignment?!
* import URLs (retrieve from web and convert)					(done)
* add dehyphenation module (as normalizer) - see pdf2xml
* integration of srtalign
* allow manual corrections (alignments and even other things?)			(started)
  --> ISA integration	   	       	   	      				(prototype)
  --> limit the number of sentalign files that can be open for edit
  --> setup ISA									(done)
  --> upload from ISA (overwrite?)						(done)
  --> remove corpus from ISA							(done)
  --> color-coded confidence in ISA
  --> mark corpus that is already done/saved with ISA
  --> keep confidence scores for links that are not changed in ISA
  --> interactive dependency annotation						(started)
* user interface (for uploads, OPUS integration)				(started)


Medium priority:

* jobs for web-crawling (using bitextor, e.g. bitextor integration)
* improve git with remote servers (do not always push! betteru user of commit command?!)
* allow tags in version-control backends (at least for the git backend)
* better fuzzy matching of file names (translation detection)
  --> lowercased file names
  --> without non-letter characters
  --> remove/replace language names/IDs from names
  --> even match translated names? (difficult)
      (use simple lexical matches with prob's?)
* find translated documents based on their contents (difficult)
  --> use external tools for searching parallel documents?
* more sentence aligners (srtalign, BLEU align, gargantua, yalign?)
* support moving files (i.e. git mv in backend)
* allow tagging of releases
* update language detection (langid.py, cld2)
  https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Lingua::Identify::CLD2
* improved pre-processing tools
  - UDpipe									(started)
  - optimized sentence splitters, tokenizers
  - boilerplate removal etc (e.g. http://corpus.tools/wiki/Justext)
    https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Identify::BoilerPlate
* stable web interface with configuration support				(started)
* slurm job manager (parameters, resource management missing)			(working)
  --> distributed setup
  --> resource configuration and different queues?
* integrate bicleaner (or similar tools)?
  https://github.com/bitextor/bicleaner
  pre-trained models from ParaCrawl
* integrate other tokenizers for specific languages
  (mecab for ja ...)
* code optimization (backends, validation, conversion ...)


Low priority:

* use poppler bindings for PDF (https://metacpan.org/pod/Poppler)
  --> also in pd2xml!! (check also inline java for pdfxtk)
  --> Poppler may not include text extraction tools in the library?!
  https://github.com/tamirhassan/pdfxtk/blob/master/pdfXtk/src/main/java/at/ac/tuwien/dbai/pdfwrap/ProcessFile.java
* better bindings of chared (python bindings?) + newer version?
  http://corpus.tools/wiki/Chared
  via Inline::Python?
  https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Inline-Python/Python.pod
* git backend									(done)
  - user-subtrees as branches and not copies					(done)
  - remote repositories (master), 
  - user-branches as local copies in compressed filesystem?
  - remote on save server?
* better bindings for git with (do we need that?)
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Git
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Git::Class
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Git::Raw
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Git::XS
* trainable sentence splitters & tokenizers (openNLP, other?)
* automatic load-balancing in distributed setups
* integrate stanford core NLP?
  server: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/corenlp-server.html


Done:

* integrate pdf2xml								(done)
  (need to improve pdf2xml! too slow! use Tika server!)
* install and setup Apache Tika as a server and call it from Apache::Tika 	(done!)
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31733709/auto-restart-a-tika-server
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Apache::Tika
* add call to job API to start import for individual files			(already works!)
* improve the way parallel documents are found					(done)
  --> more efficient! (already for identicial names)				(using String::Approx)
  --> some fuzzy matching on names (but not the complicated way it is now!)
* (semi-)automatic identification of parallel documents (without requiring identical file names)
  --> fuzzi name matching is already in place?! --> bad implementation!
  check string comparison matching modules like
  https://metacpan.org/pod/String::Approx
  https://metacpan.org/pod/release/GRAY/Tree-Suffix-0.21/lib/Tree/Suffix.pm

  https://metacpan.org/pod/release/JOESUF/Algorithm-LCS-1.04/LCS.pm
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Algorithm::Diff
* update Apache Tika (plus allow options?)					(done, no options)
