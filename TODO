To do as of version 0.50
========================


* use poppler bindings for PDF (https://metacpan.org/pod/Poppler)
  --> also in pd2xml!! (check also inline java for pdfxtk)
  --> Poppler may not include text extraction tools in the library?!
  https://github.com/tamirhassan/pdfxtk/blob/master/pdfXtk/src/main/java/at/ac/tuwien/dbai/pdfwrap/ProcessFile.java
* add dehyphenation module (as normalizer) - see pdf2xml
* better bindings of chared (python bindings?) + newer version?
  http://corpus.tools/wiki/Chared
  via Inline::Python?
  https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Inline-Python/Python.pod
* add call to job API to start import for individual files			(already works!)
* slurm job manager (parameters, resource management missing)			(working)
* git backend									(done)
  - user-subtrees as branches and not copies					(done)
  - remote repositories (master), 
  - user-branches as local copies in compressed filesystem?
  - remote on save server?
* better bindings for git with (do we need that?)
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Git
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Git::Class
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Git::Raw
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Git::XS
* code optimization (backends, validation, conversion ...)
* trainable sentence splitters & tokenizers (openNLP, other?)
* improved pre-processing tools (
  - UDpipe									(started)
  - optimized sentence splitters, tokenizers
* stable web interface with configuration support				(started)
* automatic load-balancing in distributed setups
* update Apache Tika (plus allow options?)
* integrate pdf2xml								(done)
  (need to improve pdf2xml! too slow! use Tika server!)
* install and setup Apache Tika as a server and call it from Apache::Tika 	(done!)

Wish-list
==========

* (semi-)automatic identification of parallel documents (without requiring identical file names)
  --> fuzzi name matching is already in place?!
* more sentence aligners (BLEU align, gargantua, yalign?)
* user interface (for uploads, OPUS integration)
* allow manual corrections (alignments and even other things?)
* integrate stanford core NLP?
