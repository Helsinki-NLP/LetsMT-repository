To do as of version 0.50
========================


* install and setup Apache Tika as a server and call it from Apache::Tika
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31733709/auto-restart-a-tika-server
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Apache::Tika
* update Apache Tika (plus allow options?)
* integrate pdf2xml (on-going)
* slurm job manager (working, parameters, resource management missing)
* git backend (done)
  better bindings with
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Git
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Git::Class
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Git::Raw
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Git::XS
* code optimization (svn backend, validation, conversion ...)
* trainable sentence splitters & tokenizers (openNLP, other?)
* stable web interface with configuration support
* automatic load-balancing in distributed setups


Wish-list
==========


* better git backend:
  - user-subtrees as branches and not copies
  - remote repositories (master), user-branches as local copies (in compressed filesystem?)
  - remote on save server?
* improved pre-processing tools (UDpipe?, optimized sentence splitters, tokenizers)
* (semi-)automatic identification of parallel documents (without requiring identical file names)
* more sentence aligners (BLEU align, gargantua, yalign?)
* user interface (for uploads, OPUS integration)
* allow manual corrections (alignments and even other things?)
