# LetsMT! Resource Repository #
###############################

LetsMT! <http://www.letsmt.eu> is a project on "Building a Platform for Online
Sharing of  Training Data and  Building User Tailored MT".  This package holds
the software contributed  by the  Computational Linguistics  group at  Uppsala
University, called the Resource Repository.

Lot's of changes since version 0.52 done at the University of
Helsinki. For more information: Look into CHANGES and the
documentation in doc/.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================
* One ("monolithic" installation) or several PCs (distributed installation)
  or (for testing) virtual machines.
  - tested on 64-bit systems, though 32-bit systems should also be possible
* GNU/Linux operating system
  - tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
  - the installation installs needed software with the  Debian package manager
    "apt", so a Debian system (Debian, Ubuntu) is at least necessary for
    out-of-the-box installation
* Perl 5.10 or higher
* Apache 2.x with ModPerl


INSTALLATION
============
See the file INSTALL  for quick single-server  installation instructions.  For
more extensive instructions and further installation options,  see the section
"LetsMT Repository Installation and Configuration Instructions" on the project
Wiki <http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/letsmt-trac/>, or on the DVD, the files in the
directory "resource-repository/wiki/install+config".
