Scots (or "Lallans" a poetic spellin for lawlands) is a leid that's spak in the Scots lawlands, Northren Isles an in Northren Ireland an the Republic o Ireland (whaur it's kent as "Ullans" in offeecal circles, but by ordinar fowks as "Scotch" or "Scots"). In maist airts, it's spak alangside the Scots Gaelic an Inglis leids.
Up tae the 15t century Scottis (modren form Scots) wis the name o Gaelic the Celtic leid o the auncient Scots, inbrocht fae Ireland aboot 500 AD). Thaim that uised Scots cawed Gaelic Erse (meanin Irish). The Gaelic o Scotland is nou maistlie cawed Scots Gaelic an is yit spak by some in the wastren Hielands an islands. For the maist pairt, Scots comes fae the Northumbrian kin o Anglo-Saxon (Auld Inglis), tho wi influence fae Norse by the wey o the Vikings, Dutch an Laich Saxon throu troke wi, an incomers fae, the laich kintras, an Romance by the wey o kirk an legal Laitin, Anglo-Norman an syne Pairisian French acause o the Auld Alliance.
Anglian speakers wis weel staiblisht in sooth-east Scotland by the 7t century. In the 13t century Norman landawners an thair reteeners, speakin Northumbrian Middle Inglis, wis inveetit tae come an sattle by the Keeng. Scots kythed for the first time in leeterar furm in the mids o the 14t century an didna differ muckle fae ither northren Inglis byleids. The Anglian leid o Scotland growed on its ain sinsyne. By the late 15t century the sicht fowk haed o the differs wi the leid spoken faurder sooth cam tae the fore an Scots-speakin Scots stairtit tae caw thair leid Scots. Scots haes lend-wirds fae the fact that the Scots fowk haed contact wi Gaelic speakers. Thair lend-wirds is for ordinar juist for geographical an cultural thingies, sic as clan an loch. Like ony leevin leid, Scot haes cheenged a bittie ower the years, tho it haes arguably steyed closer tae its Anglo-Saxon spring-heid nor Inglis. Monie Scots wirds haes become pairt o Inglis an aw: flit, greed, eerie, cuddle, clan, stob.

Scotland (Gaelic: Alba) is a kintra in nor'-wast Europe, an is ane o the fower kintras[1] that maks the Unitit Kinrick. It taks up the northren thrid o the Breetish island. The laund haes til its sooth the laund o Ingland, an is bund bi the German Ocean tae the east an the Atlantic Ocean tae the north an wast.
It aforetimes wis a free kinrick, but then Scotland gaed intil a personal union wi Ingland in 1603, whan Jamie the Saxt o Scotland becam James I o Ingland efter the daith o Elizabeth I. This union wis makkit formal on 1 Mey, 1707 bi the Treaty o Union. The Scots Pairlament wis gotten rid o on 26 Mairch. The union southert baith kinriks, makkin the Kinrick o Great Breetain, wi a new single Pairlament haudden in Wastmeenster, Lunnon, but some pairts o Scotland's institutions, notably the laund's naitional kirk an education an legal seestems, wis hauden apairt. In 1801, Scotland becam ane o the three launds o the Unitit Kinrick, alang wi Ingland and Irland (nou juist Northren Ireland). Wales is nou seen for uisal as anither laund altho it wis juist a principalitie o the kinrick o Ingland in 1707.
In 1997, the Scots fowk voted tae hae a new pairlament, estaiblisht bi the UK govrenment in the Scotland Act 1998. The nou devolved Scots Pairlament haes been gien the pouer tae govern the laund on maist Scots maiters, but haesna ower muckle pouer wi taxes altho it dis hae the pouer tae chynge the UK income tax rate by 3p in the poond.
Scotland's size is maistly that estaiblisht bi the 1237 Treaty o York atween Scotland an Ingland an the 1266 Treatie o Perth atween Scotland an Norrowey. Exceptions is the Isle o Mann, that is nou a croun dependency ootwi the Unitit Kinrick, Orkney an Shetland, that is nou Scots raither nor Dens, an Berwick-upon-Tweed, that wis defined as subject tae the laws o Ingland bi the 1746 Wales an Berwick Act.
The patron saunt o Scotland is Saunt Andra, an St. Andra's Day is on 30 November but it haesna been muckle celebratit syne the Reformation.
