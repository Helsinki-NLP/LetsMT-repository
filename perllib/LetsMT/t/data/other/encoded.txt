Getting to the venue
Arrival in Dubrovnik: When arriving to Dubrovnik Airport you can take a taxi to your respective accommodation (the price is around 200 HRK, approx. 30 EUR). The journey takes about 25 minutes. You can also take a bus that leaves the airport after every landing of regular flights and takes you to the City. These buses will be marked on the window shield with the sign Airport – Dubrovnik and the bus fare is 35 HRK (approx. 5 EUR). You can take the bus from the airport to the Pile stop or Central Bus 

Terminal. Both are equally distant from the Hotel Lero and on both locations there is a local bus and taxi stand. The bus ticket can be purchased at any newsstand. Taxi can also be reached at any place and any time by calling Radio taxi service (020) 970. 
You can get more details at web page http://hnk.ffzg.hr/fassbl2010/venue.html which was prepared for a conference back in 2010.
