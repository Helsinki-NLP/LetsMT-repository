The local and regional role of economic policy will be emphasized.
Regional development will thereby be reinforced, the EU's Structural Funds better utilized and industry and commerce promoted.
The role of the local authorities in labour market policy will be developed.
The local authorities are the ones with expertise on local conditions and solutions.
Economic crime will be combated - both in order to uphold common values in society and to ensure that honest businessmen are not affected by unsound competition.
The supply of capital will be reinforced by the introduction of a sixth National Pension Insurance Fund which will have considerable opportunities for placing its assets in small and medium-sized companies.
The Government aims to pursue a more stable and predictable policy to improve the investment opportunities for companies and strengthen domestic demand.
The third corner-stone is life-long learning
Sweden will be competing with high qualifications, not low wages.
The concept of life-long learning will be realized.
School, pre-school and leisure centre services will be integrated in order to improve the first important years a child spends at compulsory school.
The quality of upper secondary schools will be improved and post-secondary education will be expanded.
An additional 100,000 people will be given an opportunity for regular education, 70,000 of these in adult education.
Priority will be given to those who have so far had the smallest share of society's educational resources.
Unemployed persons will be given the opportunity to acquire upper secondary education.
Swedish higher education and research will continue to hold a position among the foremost in the world.
Interdisciplinary and applied research will be reinforced and research cooperation between the EU countries fully utilized.
Regional development will receive a powerful boost by the expansion of the universities throughout the country.
This will provide hope for the future, stimulate industry and commerce and create new jobs.
The fourth corner-stone is a new contract for cooperation.
Agreement has been the basis for the stability and trust in the future which has characterized Swedish society for so long.
Cooperation is the key in the fight for full employment.
A decline in unemployment must be combined with inflation at a good European level.
This requires that both trade union organizations and employers take unique responsibility for extensive changes to the system of negotiation and wage formation, and for labour law.
The Government and Parliament are ultimately responsible for stability in the labour market.
