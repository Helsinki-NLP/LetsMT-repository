<p id="5">
 <s id="s5.1">Madam  Speaker, honourable Members of the Swedish Parliament,</s>
</p>

<p id="6">
 <s id="s6.1">Reducing unemployment is the foremost and overriding task of my  Government.</s> 
 <s id="s6.2">Our goal is that Sweden will have halved open unemployment to  4 per cent by the year 2000.</s>
</p>

<p id="7">
 <s id="s7.1">The foundation for a sound society is undermined by today's high rate of  unemployment.</s> 
 <s id="s7.2">Both the national economy and morals and initiatives are  weakened.</s> 
 <s id="s7.3">Ultimately, the fight for full employment concerns the cohesion of  Swedish society.</s>
</p>

<p id="8">
 <s id="s8.1">The Government's policy to combat unemployment will rest on four corner- stones:</s>
</p>

<p id="9">
 <s id="s9.1">The first corner-stone is stable and sustainable finances.</s>
</p>

<p id="10">
 <s id="s10.1">Sound public finances are the basis for all political ambitions.</s> 
 <s id="s10.2">Efforts to put  public finances on a better footing will continue.</s> 
 <s id="s10.3">The goal is to limit the deficit  to 3 per cent of GDP in 1997 and to achieve a balance in public finances in  1998.</s> 
 <s id="s10.4">A new budget process with a stronger follow-up and a nominal ceiling  for expenditure will create favourable preconditions for commencing the  necessary reduction of the public debt burden.</s> 
 <s id="s10.5">Price increases have been  forced down to under two per cent, and inflation will continue to be kept at a  low rate.</s> 
 <s id="s10.6">In this way, there will be scope for continued interest rate reductions.</s>
</p>

<p id="11">
 <s id="s11.1">Under no circumstances can the Government accept the further undermining  of the welfare society by large deficits and a galloping national debt.</s>
</p>

<p id="12">
 <s id="s12.1">The second corner-stone is the provision of favourable conditions for  companies and enterprise.</s>
</p>

<p id="13">
 <s id="s13.1">Sweden is a good country for enterprise.</s> 
 <s id="s13.2">We have a flexible economy, a  constructive climate for cooperation, and a competent and well educated  labour force.</s> 
 <s id="s13.3">The Government will further improve conditions for enterprise.</s>
</p>

<p id="14">
 <s id="s14.1">There has been a substantial increase in the number of jobs created in small  and medium-sized businesses.</s> 
 <s id="s14.2">This is a sound development which will be  strengthened by vocational training, support for innovations, supply of capital  and company support.</s> 
 <s id="s14.3">The Government's policies will provide improved  opportunities for new establishment, development and expansion.</s>
</p>

<p id="15">
 <s id="s15.1">The local and regional role of economic policy will be emphasized.</s> 
 <s id="s15.2">Regional  development will thereby be reinforced, the EU's Structural Funds better  utilized and industry and commerce promoted.</s>
</p>

<p id="16">
 <s id="s16.1">The role of the local authorities in labour market policy will be developed.</s> 
 <s id="s16.2">The  local authorities are the ones with expertise on local conditions and solutions.</s>
</p>

<p id="17">
 <s id="s17.1">Economic crime will be combated - both in order to uphold common values in  society and to ensure that honest businessmen are not affected by unsound  competition.</s>
</p>

<p id="18">
 <s id="s18.1">The supply of capital will be reinforced by the introduction of a sixth National  Pension Insurance Fund which will have considerable opportunities for  placing its assets in small and medium-sized companies.</s>
</p>

<p id="19">
 <s id="s19.1">The Government aims to pursue a more stable and predictable policy to  improve the investment opportunities for companies and strengthen domestic  demand.</s>
</p>

<p id="20">
 <s id="s20.1">The third corner-stone is life-long learning</s>
</p>

<p id="21">
 <s id="s21.1">Sweden will be competing with high qualifications, not low wages.</s> 
 <s id="s21.2">The  concept of life-long learning will be realized.</s>
</p>

<p id="22">
 <s id="s22.1">School, pre-school and leisure centre services will be integrated in order to  improve the first important years a child spends at compulsory school.</s> 
 <s id="s22.2">The  quality of upper secondary schools will be improved and post-secondary  education will be expanded.</s>
</p>

<p id="23">
 <s id="s23.1">An additional 100,000 people will be given an opportunity for regular  education, 70,000 of these in adult education.</s> 
 <s id="s23.2">Priority will be given to those  who have so far had the smallest share of society's educational resources.</s>  
 <s id="s23.3">Unemployed persons will be given the opportunity to acquire upper secondary  education.</s>
</p>

<p id="24">
 <s id="s24.1">Swedish higher education and research will continue to hold a position among  the foremost in the world.</s>

 <s id="s26.2">Cooperation is the key in the  fight for full employment.</s>
</p>

<p id="27">
 <s id="s27.1">A decline in unemployment must be combined with inflation at a good  European level.</s> 
 <s id="s27.2">This requires that both trade union organizations and  employers take unique responsibility for extensive changes to the system of  negotiation and wage formation, and for labour law.</s> 
 <s id="s27.3">The Government and  Parliament are ultimately responsible for stability in the labour market.</s>
</p>

 <s id="s30.2">This is a  success for our policies.</s> 
 <s id="s30.3">In order to intensify this work, it is highly important  that a special chapter on employment be introduced into the EU Treaties.</s>
</p>

<p id="31">
 <s id="s31.1">Sustainable public finances, favourable conditions for enterprise, life-long  learning and a contract for cooperation are the four corner-stones.</s> 
 <s id="s31.2">On this  basis the Government invites the political parties, the parties to the labour  market and all of the people of Sweden to jointly quell unemployment.</s> 
 <s id="s31.3">Only in  this way can we realize the Sweden of our dreams.</s>
