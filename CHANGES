== 0.52 - 0.55 ==

* undocumented changes

== 0.51 ==

Release date: '''2012-09-20'''.

=== Major changes ===

* Bug fix in installation routines (setting environment variables for the Apache:443 host)
* Better integration of OpenNLP sentence splitters (using Inline Java)
* Bug fix in the Text Importer (conversion to UTF-8 in validation step)


== 0.50 ==

Release date: '''2012-09-17'''.

The LetsMT! Resource Repository is now officially licensed under the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/ GNU General Public License].

=== Major changes ===

* improved handling of large imports:
  * individual files from archives are uploaded from the grid client to the repository as soon as they are processed
  * creation of import jobs is deferred to a "master job" on the grid (via new //letsmt_make//) so that the user interface is operable again ASAP after a command
* all temporary files obey the directory choice made in the environment variable $LETSMT_TMP
* no direct communication between RR server and group database (fixes bug in v 0.44)
* //letsmt_rest//:
  * displays more specific error information
  * displays a bit more verbose status information in the case of setting/deleting commands
  * command-line option //-x// has XML responses converted into a more human-readable format (vaguely similar to [http://haml.info/ HAML]) that uses indentation rather than "<tag>...</tag>" syntax to show structure (the lines of multiline text content, such as that returned by "cat", are marked by vertical bars "|" at the left)
* //test suite//:
  * split into "fast" and "slow" tests
  * ordered such that fundamental operations are checked before others that rely on them
  * common operations outsourced into central //Scaffold.pm//
  * standard operations (user, slot management) are only tested once, so that the number of tests shown at the end gives a better impression of how many individual aspects actually are tested
* //distributed installation//:
  * as-installed configuration on Frontend, SGE clients points to server
  * SSL-transfer hint printed at the end of the installation
  
* includes a Web user interface for the resource repository, called the //"Grenzschnitte"//
  * optional, [RepositorySetup#webui installed separately]
  * runs as a system service, reachable on port 81 or port 3000
